## Resources for learning Statistical Phylogenetics

Sometimes students ask me how to learn statistical phylogenetics, usually the 'phylo' part. These notes are my attempt to point people in the direction of good resources. 

#### Books

- [``SS2003``](https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=en&lr=&id=uR8i2qetjSAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=phylogenetics+semple+steel&ots=_axt0_fnAT&sig=Xnsk6k1l5jBgnRhBEX8dE76-qfE&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=phylogenetics%20semple%20steel&f=false) Semple, C., & Steel, M. (2003). Phylogenetics (Vol. 24). Oxford University Press on Demand. 
    * This is a book written by mathematicians for mathematicians. A true classic.
- [``DB2015``](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139095112) Drummond, A. J., & Bouckaert, R. R. (2015). Bayesian evolutionary analysis with BEAST. Cambridge University Press.
    * This is a book focused on time-calibrated phylogenies and Bayesian inference of such objects _via_ Markov chain Monte Carlo.

### Specific topics

- **What are trees?** If you're looking for a rigorous definition of trees, chapters 2 and 3 of ``SS2003`` present a construction from first principles. Section 1.3.1 of [Carvalho (2019)](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35510) and Chapter 2 of ``DB2015`` address time-calibrated phylogenies specifically.
